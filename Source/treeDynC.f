c ... For seasonal deciduous/conifer forest system, reapportion growth
c ... This applies only to non-drought systems.
c ... From Bill Parton (April 2000):
c ... "For the drought decidious plants the main impact is to have leaves
c ... drop in response to drought stress. You don't want leaf growth
c ... initiated the same way as traditional decidious plants. Drought
c ... decidious plants have their leaf growth start when it get wet enough
c ... and is not controlled by temperature directly like the traditional
c ... decidious plants."
