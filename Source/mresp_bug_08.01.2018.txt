I have a fix for a bug in the maintenance respiration in treegrow.
The bug generates a negative C storage, carbostg, when a non-growing tree is
removed. Negative storage is a fatal error in livrem.
(this is only the fatal part of a cluster of errors   :-) )

The error in the maintenance respiration stems from the fact that
respiration occurs in non-growing trees which removes C from storage but
C is only added during active growth. A long period of non-growth will
exhaust the storage pool. The removal can go negative at zero rleavc_opt
but even if the intercept is zero, round-off error in the allocation of
small amounts does the rest.


The fix comes in 2 parts.
1 make fmrsplai(2) the minimum value for the storage pool
impact on respiration. My parameters make that value 0 at 0 leaf
potential but there is no guarantee in the input of that intercept 
it is possible to imagine a slope that would give a negative impact 0

OLD CODE ==============================================
        if (carbostg(FORSYS,UNLABL)+carbostg(FORSYS,LABELD) .lt. &
            fmrsplai(3) * rleavc_opt) then
          mrspReduce = &
            line(carbostg(FORSYS,UNLABL)+carbostg(FORSYS,LABELD), &
                 fmrsplai(1) * rleavc_opt, fmrsplai(2), &
                 fmrsplai(3) * rleavc_opt, fmrsplai(4))
        elseif (carbostg(FORSYS,UNLABL)+carbostg(FORSYS,LABELD) .gt. &
                fmrsplai(5) * rleavc_opt) then
          mrspReduce = fmrsplai(6)
        else
          mrspReduce = &
            line(carbostg(FORSYS,UNLABL)+carbostg(FORSYS,LABELD), &
                 fmrsplai(3) * rleavc_opt, fmrsplai(4), &
                 fmrsplai(5) * rleavc_opt, fmrsplai(6))
        endif

NEW CODE ==============================================
      cstor = sum(carbostg(FORSYS,:)) ! intermediate value

        ! limit mrspReduce below the minimum value
        if (cstor .le. fmrsplai(1) * rleavc_opt) then         ! minimum value
          mrspReduce = fmrsplai(2)

        elseif (cstor .ge. fmrsplai(5) * rleavc_opt) then     ! maximum value
          mrspReduce = fmrsplai(6)

        elseif (cstor .lt. fmrsplai(3) * rleavc_opt) then     ! first segment

          mrspReduce = line(cstor, fmrsplai(1) * rleavc_opt, fmrsplai(2), &
                                   fmrsplai(3) * rleavc_opt, fmrsplai(4))

        else                                                  ! second segment
          mrspReduce = line(cstor, fmrsplai(3) * rleavc_opt, fmrsplai(4), &
                                   fmrsplai(5) * rleavc_opt, fmrsplai(6))
        endif
Of course, you have to type the new variable cstor



2 The second fix is to set a maximum respiration of the storage pool
OLD:          mrspdyflux(FORSYS) = sum(fmrspdyflux)

NEW:          mrspdyflux(FORSYS) = max(sum(fmrspdyflux), cstor)

The revised routine will be available later today
