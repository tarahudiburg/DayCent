      real     cflow, tca, rcetob, anps, bnps, labile, mnrflo

c ... Schedule N, P, or S flow and associated mineralization or
c ... immobilization flow for decomposition from Box A to Box B.
c ... written by vek 05/91

c ... Input:
c ...   cflow  = C flow from Box A to Box B
c ...   tca    = total C (unlabeled + labeled) in Box A
c ...   rcetob = C/N, C/P, or C/S ratio of new material being added
c ...            to Box B
c ...   time   = simulation time, passed in /zztim/
c ...
c ... Transput:
c ...   anps   = N, P, or S state variable for Box A
c ...   bnps   = N, P, or S state variable for Box B
c ...   labile = minerl(1,iel) where iel indicates N, P, or S
c ...
c ... Output:
c ...   mnrflo = amount of N, P, or S that is mineralized or
c ...            immobilized.
c ...
c ... A positive value of mnrflow indicates mineralization;
c ... a negative value of mnrflow indicates immobilization.
