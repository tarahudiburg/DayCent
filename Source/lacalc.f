c ... Calculate true LAI using leaf biomass and a biomass-to-LAI
c ... conversion parameter which is the slope of a regression
c ... line derived from LAI vs Foliar Mass for Slash Pine.

c ... Calculate theoretical LAI as a function of large wood mass.
c ... There is no strong consensus on the true nature of the relationship
c ... between LAI and stemwood mass.  Version 3.0 used a negative exponential
c ... relationship between leaf mass and large wood mass, which tended to
c ... break down in very large forests.  Many sutdies have cited as "general"
c ... an increase of LAI up to a maximum, then a decrease to a plateau value
c ... (e.g. Switzer et al. 1968, Gholz and Fisher 1982).  However, this
c ... response is not general, and seems to mostly be a feature of young
c ... pine plantations.  Northern hardwoods have shown a monotonic increase
c ... to a plateau  (e.g. Switzer et al. 1968).  Pacific Northwest conifers
c ... have shown a steady increase in LAI with no plateau evident (e.g.
c ... Gholz 1982).  In this version, we use a simple saturation fucntion in
c ... which LAI increases linearly against large wood mass initially, then
c ... approaches a plateau value.  The plateau value can be set very large to
c ... give a response of steadily increasing LAI with stemwood.
